# Data Science Portfolio by Kim Y. Egbert

## Description

This repo contains data science projects in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Each of the repo subdirectories contain a stand-alone data science project.

## Projects

### Time Series Forecasting

[Time Series Forecasting with Chicago Tree Trim Requests](/chicago-tree-trims-time-series-forecasting)
Using the Seasonal ARIMA time series forecasting model, predict the expected volume of Chicago's 311 tree trim opened requests and closed requests between November 2018 - October 2019. Techniques and technologies used in this project include Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, structured data, machine learning, time series forecasting, Seasonal ARIMA, StatsModels, Matplotlib, data wrangling, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, training and testing sets, and grid search.

### Natural Language Processing

[Detecting Literary Themes in James Joyce's Works Using Natural Language Processing](/james-joyce-natural-language-processing)
Using the Natural Language Processing techniques of sentiment analysis, TF-IDF weighting, topic modeling and bigram networks to accurately detect the literary themes of the early twentieth century writer James Joyce. Techniques and technologies used in this project include Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, machine learning, unstructured data, data preprocessing, data visualization, Natural Language Processing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, TF-IDF, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Markov chain, NLTK, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and network graphs.
