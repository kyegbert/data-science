# Don't Eat that Mushroom! Classifying Mushrooms as Poisonous or Non-Poisonous

## Project Description
While on a walk in the woods, the process of identifying poisonous mushrooms does not benefit from an easy to remember rule, such as the "leaves of three, let it be" rule for poison ivy. So, which mushroom features, from the color of its spots to the size of its gills to the habitat where it grows, can identify mushrooms as poisonous? The mushroom dataset from _The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms_ describes mushrooms according to their physical characteristics and whether or not the mushroom is poisonous. Apply different classification algorithms to the mushroom dataset to identify an algorithm that best fits the data and return the top features that classify a mushroom as poisonous vs non-poisonous.
