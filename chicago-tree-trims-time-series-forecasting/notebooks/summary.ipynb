    "# Time Series Forecasting with Chicago Tree Trim Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Chicago's 311 system allows city residents to request city-provided services, such as patching potholes, fixing non-functioning street lights or trimming parkway trees of broken or low-hanging branches. These trees, which are located on city property which sits between the sidewalk and the curb, line the streets of Chicago. Between the years 2013-2017, the 311 system received, on average, approximately 38,000 tree trim requests per year. The volume of tree trim requests that are opened in the winter are relatively low in winter and typically peak in the summers months. The volume of closed requests, indicating the trim has been completed, vary more across time than opened requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using time series forecasting, predict the expected volume of 311 tree trim opened requests and closed requests between November 2018 - October 2019.\n",

This MAE is nearly triple the MAE of the opened requests, even though the range of values for the opened and closed requests is relatively similar. The MAPE score is high. The model fit for this dataset can likely be improved. See the Next Steps section for options.\n",

    "\n",
    "When the tree trim dataset of opened requests and closed requests is aggregated at the monthly level, the resulting dataset is relatively small. This leads to wide confidence intervals and limits the parameter search for optimal model parameters. How could these models be improved?\n",
    "\n",
    "Options to improve the model fit include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Aggregate the tree trims dataset on a weekly level, which would approximately quadruple the data points in the dataset. However, this may lead to a more complicated model as weekly variation and holidays must be accounted for in the model.\n",
    "* Implement time series cross validation to increase reliability of test set accuracy metrics.\n",
    "* Incorporate weather data when modeling closed requests. The timing of closed requests may depend on weather events, precipitation and temperature, as high priority crisis trimming occurs after severe weather events and closed requests volume is typically lower in February through March."
